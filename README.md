# Wiimote-Cursor

## A Magic Mirror Module to Integrate a WiiMote That Draws on the Mirror

### Setup and Execution

Perform the following commands:

cd Wiimote-Cursor

sh setup.sh

### Usage

B to move without drawing

A to draw

hold + and -  at the same time on the controller to disconnect to the remote

## Note: This is not a good build. It draws poorly and can definitely be improved upon. It is buggy and has only been tested on a single Pi 4B running Raspbian. I might reconfigure the entire thing if I'm bored someday, although likely not, so don't expect it to be any good. The core functionality is implemented, although poorly, and that's all.
